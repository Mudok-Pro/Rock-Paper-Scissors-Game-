# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-
Plan : 
the game is playable on the console so an intergace isn't needed 
the inputs are user input 
the user will pick a rock or a paper or a scissor and the computer will get a random select 
the two options are compared ,
you wan win ; lose ; or tie 
score will increase each round 
and the winner is who reach 3 first 



we need a function to compare humanpick and cumputer pick 
also we need another function to calculate score
and a function to declare the winner
